# -Miles-videogame
A simple videogame created with Python, called "Miles". You have to guess a random-generated number composed of 4 digits. 
For each input you give the program will tell you how many of those digits are "Bien" (in the exact spot that the randomly generated) 
or "Regular" (number present in the randomly generated, but in a wrong place).

The game also let you save your score and name (on rankings.txt), and have an option to see Highscores.
The game is mainly in spanish, but it's pretty intuitive.
